# Coin-Pouch
Coin Pouch - Vault Hunters Addon

- Stores unlimited amounts of coins.
- Coins picked up will go directly into the pouch.
- Converts coins up and down like a compacting drawer. Always keeping the total amount of each and allowing to take any out.
- Works with the Shop Pedestal. No need to take the coins out of the pouch.
- Combine with Echo Pog in an Anvil to add Soulbound. (This can be disabled in config)
